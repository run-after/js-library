This is a project from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library)

In this project, I used JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create an app that allows you to add books to your virtual library. 

I used event listeners to give you the ability to change the 'read' status, as well as delete the book once already in the library. There is a button to add new books to the library as well as a form that pops up to fill in the fields.

I also used event listeners to hide/show class styles as in the form for it to pop up and an image that explains to press the 'add' button, but the image only shows when there are no books in the library.

I did light styling on this project to make it look decent, but the objective of this project was not to showcase my styling abilites, but to use JavaScript constructors and event listeners.
